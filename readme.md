# Linked List implementation in C++ for use with LCD display

This implements a menu to be shown on a LCD display (4 lines by 20 characters), connected to a microcontroller (STM32, Arduino, you name it) and controlled by a rotary encoder (alternatively it could be used with 3 buttons: up, down and select).

It uses a classic linked list and a intermediate menu layer.

In this state, menu lines are printed to the console for development and debugging.
